What is the difference between a merge and a rebase? 
Merge is used to combine changes made into a branch with the most recent commit in the main branch, while a rebase just updates which commit the branch diverges from the main. 

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a shared repository where multiple different users can commit changes and create branchs from one main branch, which allows for collaboration between multiple developers.
